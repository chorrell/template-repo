# AGENTS.md

The GitHub template (`is_template: true`) that new `chorrell` repositories are
created from. It contains only shared configuration, no application code. See
[README.md](README.md) for what each file does and the checklist for new
repositories.

## Structure

```

## Rules

- **Everything here is copied into every new repository.** Keep it
  language-agnostic. Python, Docker, Terraform and similar hooks, Dependabot
  ecosystems and ignores belong in the repositories that need them.
- **Keep this in sync with my other repositories.** When a shared default
  changes (a hook, the Dependabot layout, the markdownlint stub), change it here
  too, so new repositories don't start out of date.
- **Reusable workflows live in [chorrell/workflows](https://github.com/chorrell/workflows).**
  Workflows here are short stubs that own their triggers, `permissions` and
  `concurrency` and call the shared workflow by tag (`@v1`). Third-party actions
  are pinned by commit hash with a version comment; zizmor enforces this.
- **zizmor is the workflow linter.** Reference actions and reusable workflows
  in the same repository with GitHub's `$/` self-repository syntax
  (`uses: $/.github/workflows/build.yml`), not `./`, as zizmor's
  `self-repository` audit requires. actionlint isn't used because it rejects
  `$/` ([rhysd/actionlint#711](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint/issues/711)).
- **Repository settings aren't configured here.** Merge settings, rulesets and
  required status checks are managed by Terraform in
  [chorrell/github-settings](https://github.com/chorrell/github-settings)
  (`repos.yaml`). Don't change them in the GitHub UI.
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` before pushing (the markdownlint hook needs
  Docker). CI runs markdownlint on pull requests to `main`, and zizmor on
  every pull request and push to `main`. `zizmor / zizmor` is a required check
  on every repository, so don't remove the zizmor stub.
- Dependabot opens grouped monthly PRs: `ci(deps): ...` for Actions,
  `chore(deps): ...` for pre-commit hooks.
- Commits and PR titles use conventional commits (`feat: ...`, `ci: ...`,
  `chore(deps): ...`). Branch from `main` with a `feature/` prefix. PRs are
  squash-merged, so keep PR bodies short and focused on intent.
